# QuickResolutionSwitcher
No more fussing with Windows display settings!  This is a simple Windows app that resides in your taskbar and listens for hotkeys to switch between preset resolutions.  The available resolutions are configurable via app.config.

This app is useful if you have a widescreen monitor and find yourself wanting to share your entire desktop over Teams/Zoom/Webex with users who have standard 16x9 or 16x10 displays.  Before or during sharing, quickly toggle to a native 16x9 or 16x10 resolution.  Once you're done, toggle back to your native widescreen resolution.

# QuickResolutionSwitcher
No more manual fussing with Windows display settings!  This is a simple Windows app that resides in your taskbar and listens for hotkeys to switch between preset resolutions.  The available resolutions are configurable via app.config.  The default hotkey binding is CTRL+ALT+WIN+F<1-12> based on the index of the resolution in app.config.

This app is useful if you have a widescreen monitor and find yourself wanting to share your entire desktop over Teams/Zoom/Webex with users who have standard 16x9 or 16x10 displays.  Before or during sharing, quickly toggle to a native 16x9 or 16x10 resolution.  Once you're done, toggle back to your native widescreen resolution.

I built this app for my own personal use, but feel free to fork and modify as needed.

# QuickResolutionSwitcher
A simple Windows app that resides in your taskbar and listens for hotkeys to switch between preset resolutions for quick desktop sharing.

This app is useful if you have a widescreen monitor and wish to share your entire desktop with users who have standard 16x10 or 16x9 displays.
